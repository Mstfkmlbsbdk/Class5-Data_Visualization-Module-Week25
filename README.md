## Please create charts for Autoscout data based on the instructions below and note the most remarkable observations and summarize them in your work. 

- 1. Frequency of selected categorical variables with histogram/bar chart
- 2. Frequency of selected categorical variables with pie chart/donut
- 3. Distribution of numerical variables with histogram and boxplot/violin
* Try selected categorical variables as the 2nd and 3rd variable to see whether they make any considerable difference
- 4. Heatmap for correlation between numerical variables
- 5. Scatter matrix and/or OLS Scatter Plot for numerical variables
* Try categorical variables as the 3rd variable to see whether they make any considerable difference

### Note: You can try subplots, and facet_row and facet_column features, if you want to create multiple charts with one code cell.
